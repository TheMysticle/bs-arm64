# Installing and running

The easiest way is the ARM64 tab of the Steam Frame fork of BSManager
([TheMysticle/bs-manager-steam-frame](https://github.com/TheMysticle/bs-manager-steam-frame)), which runs this installer for you.
The rest of this page describes the installer itself.

The installer is `install/bs-arm64.sh`. It runs on the device (Steam Frame, SteamOS) and needs only
`bash`, `python3`, `curl`, `tar` and `bsdtar`, which ship with SteamOS. It also needs:

- a **Beat Saber 1.44.1** instance, e.g. from BSManager (`~/.local/share/BSManager/BSInstances/1.44.1`)
- **Proton 11.0 (ARM64)**, the exact version the DLLs were built for
- the Wine prefix already created: launch any game with it once. The default is BSManager's shared
  prefix `~/.local/share/BSManager/SharedContent/compatdata`.
- the DLLs: either a **release tarball** (unpack it and run `./bs-arm64.sh` from inside it; it uses
  the DLLs next to it), or `out/` from `build.sh` (copy the whole repo to the device, or pass
  `--artifacts DIR`)

`install` checks that `<Proton dir>/version` matches the Proton build the DLLs were made for
(`PROTON_TAG` in `versions.env`) and stops otherwise.

Work on a **copy** of an instance. BSManager can duplicate instances.

## Commands

From a release, run `./bs-arm64.sh` in the unpacked folder instead of `install/bs-arm64.sh`.

```sh
install/bs-arm64.sh fetch                 # download Unity player, UnityOpenXR, VC++ runtime (cached)
install/bs-arm64.sh install   <instance>  # patch the instance and set up the prefix (runs fetch)
install/bs-arm64.sh launch    <instance>  # start it (log: /tmp/bs-arm64.log); --debug for verbose logs
install/bs-arm64.sh uninstall <instance>  # restore the x64 files
```

Options: `--artifacts DIR`, `--cache DIR` (default `~/.cache/bs-arm64`), `--prefix DIR`,
`--proton DIR`, `--no-mods` (see [Without mods](#without-mods)).

`fetch` streams the ~500 MB Unity package once and keeps about 40 MB.

## What `install` changes

In the instance (the originals go to `<instance>/.bs-arm64/backup/`, and added files are listed in
`.bs-arm64/added`):

| File | Replaced by |
|---|---|
| `Beat Saber.exe` | Unity ARM64 `WindowsPlayer.exe` |
| `UnityPlayer.dll`, `UnityCrashHandler64.exe` | Unity ARM64 |
| `MonoBleedingEdge/EmbedRuntime/mono-2.0-bdwgc.dll` | Unity ARM64 |
| `MonoBleedingEdge/EmbedRuntime/MonoPosixHelper.dll` | built (zlib helper) |
| `dxgi.dll`, `d3d11.dll` (new) | built (DXVK aarch64) |
| `vcruntime140.dll`, `vcruntime140_1.dll`, `msvcp140.dll` (new) | Microsoft ARM64 runtime |
| `openxr_loader.dll` (new, next to the exe) | built |
| `Beat Saber_Data/Plugins/ARM64/` (new) | `steam_api64.dll`, `LIV_Bridge.dll` (stub), `UnityOpenXR.dll` (patched), `openxr_loader.dll` |
| `winhttp.dll` (only if BSIPA is installed) | ARM64 Doorstop |
| `Libs/MonoMod.Core.dll` (only if BSIPA 4.3.7's MonoMod.Core 1.3.3 is installed) | patched MonoMod.Core |

The game data and `Managed/*.dll` are not touched. The x64 plugins stay in `Plugins/x86_64/`, where the
ARM64 player ignores them.

In the prefix:

| Item | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pfx/drive_c/bs-arm64/aarch64-windows/{lsteamclient_a64,wineopenxr_a64}.dll` | Wine builtins, found through `WINEDLLPATH` |
| `pfx/drive_c/bs-arm64/aarch64-unix/*.so` | symlinks to Proton's `lsteamclient.so` / `wineopenxr.so` |
| `pfx/drive_c/bs-arm64/wineopenxr_a64.json` | OpenXR runtime manifest for ARM64 processes |
| `pfx/drive_c/bs-arm64/proton-version` | Proton build these must match |
| `HKLM\Software\Khronos\OpenXR\1` `ActiveRuntimeARM64` | read by our `openxr_loader.dll` before `ActiveRuntime` |

x64 games in the same prefix are unaffected: they ignore the ARM64 value and directory.

## Mods

Install BSIPA and mods as usual. BSManager works: its IPA run uses the x86 copy of `IPA.exe`.
Then run `install/bs-arm64.sh install <instance>` **again**, because `IPA.exe` puts its x64
`winhttp.dll` back. The installer replaces BSIPA's `winhttp.dll` and `Libs/MonoMod.Core.dll`, and
keeps backups. Mods that ship their own native x64 DLLs won't load their native parts.

Known issue: SiraUtil restarts the XR session at startup. If the headset goes into standby at that
moment (for example, it isn't being worn), Unity sometimes doesn't recreate its eye textures, and the
headset only shows a black window. Keep the headset on while the game starts, or restart the game.

### Without mods

```sh
install/bs-arm64.sh install <instance> --no-mods   # ARM64 engine only; BSIPA's files stay untouched
install/bs-arm64.sh launch  <instance> --no-mods   # start once without mods (instance installed with mods)
```

- `install --no-mods` installs only the ARM64 engine. BSIPA's `winhttp.dll` and
  `Libs/MonoMod.Core.dll` are left alone, or put back if an earlier install had replaced them. The
  choice is stored in `.bs-arm64/mods`, and such an instance always starts without mods. Run `install`
  without the option to turn mods back on.
- `launch --no-mods` starts the game vanilla this one time. It loads Wine's builtin `winhttp` instead
  of BSIPA's Doorstop, so BSIPA and every mod stay unloaded; the files aren't changed.

## Launching

`launch` runs `proton run "Beat Saber.exe"` with the usual Steam and Proton variables plus:

- `WINEDLLPATH=<prefix>/pfx/drive_c/bs-arm64`
- `DISABLE_VULKAN_FDM_INJECTION_LAYER=1`
- `WINEDLLOVERRIDES=winhttp=n,b`: BSIPA's Doorstop, if present
- `DISPLAY=:0` and `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, only if unset (e.g. started over SSH). Without a display, the
  player hangs silently right after start.

SteamVR must be running, which it always is in the Frame's game mode. SteamVR recognizes the game as
`steam.app.620980`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| `[Steam] Not being able to initialize the platform` | `steam_api64.dll` not in `Plugins/ARM64`, or `WINEDLLPATH` missing; run `launch --debug` and look for `steam_api64(arm64)` lines |
| `DllNotFoundException: UnityOpenXR` | `Plugins/ARM64/UnityOpenXR.dll` missing, or msvcp140/vcruntime140 missing |
| `xrCreateInstance: XR_ERROR_RUNTIME_UNAVAILABLE` | registry value or JSON missing; `launch --debug` shows the loader's messages as `debugstr` lines |
| `xrCreateSession: XR_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILURE` | WineD3D in use instead of DXVK: `dxgi.dll`/`d3d11.dll` not next to the exe, or `PROTON_USE_WINED3D` set |
| crash in `unityopenxr` / `ucrtbase` on recenter | Microsoft VC++ runtime missing next to the exe |
| back to menu with "Could not load readonly beatmap level data" | x64 `MonoPosixHelper.dll` still in place |
| BSIPA log: `Invalid installation; please buy the game` / no `Logs/` folder | a file named `*steam*` of 350 KB or more in the game folder or `Beat Saber_Data/Plugins` (BSIPA anti-piracy) |
| BSIPA log: `doesn't provide a default ABI` | x64/original `Libs/MonoMod.Core.dll`; run `install` again |
| black window in the headset with mods | see *Known issue* under Mods |
| game process idles at 0 % CPU, no `Player.log` | no X display; set `DISPLAY` (launch defaults to `:0`) |
| `launch` refuses: "Proton changed" | rebuild for the new Proton and reinstall (see BUILD.md) |

The game log is at `<prefix>/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/LocalLow/Hyperbolic Magnetism/Beat Saber/Player.log`.
SteamVR's per-session stats are in `~/.local/share/Steam/logs/vrcompositor.txt` (search for
`Cumulative stats for pid`).
